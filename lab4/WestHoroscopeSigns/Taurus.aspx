            <p>Taurus (Latin for "the Bull"; symbol: Taurus.svg, Unicode: ♉) is the second astrological sign in the present zodiac. It spans the 30–60th degree of the zodiac. The Sun is in the sign of Taurus from about April 20 until about May 21[2] (Western astrology) or from about May 16 to June 16 [3] (Sidereal astrology). People born between these dates, depending on which system of astrology they subscribe to, may be called Taureans.
