            <p>Pisces (♓) (/ˈpaɪsiːz/,[2] pis'eez;[3] Ancient Greek: Ἰχθύες Ikhthyes) is the twelfth astrological sign in the Zodiac, originating from the Pisces constellation. It spans the 330° to 360° of the zodiac, between 332.75° and 360° of celestial longitude. Under the tropical zodiac the sun transits this area on average between February 19 and March 20,[a][4] and under the sidereal zodiac, the sun transits this area between approximately March 13 and April 13. The symbol of the fish is derived from the ichthyocentaurs, who aided Aphrodite when she was born from the sea.[5]

                According to some tropical astrologers, the current astrological age is the Age of Pisces,[6] while others maintain that it is the Age of Aquarius.
