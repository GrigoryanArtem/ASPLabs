            <p>Capricorn (♑) /ˈkæp.rɪˌkɔːrn/ is the tenth astrological sign in the zodiac, originating from the constellation of Capricornus. It spans the 270–300th degree of the zodiac, corresponding to celestial longitude. Under the tropical zodiac, the sun transits this area from December 22 to January 19 each year, and under the sidereal zodiac, the sun transits the constellation of Capricorn from approximately January 16 to February 16. In astrology, Capricorn is considered an earth sign, negative sign,[2][3] and one of the four cardinal signs. Capricorn is said to be ruled by the planet Saturn. Its symbol is based on the Sumerians' primordial god of wisdom and waters, Enki,[4] with the head and upper body of a goat and the lower body and tail of a fish.[5] Later known as Ea in Akkadian and Babylonian mythology, Enki was the god of intelligence (gestú, literally "ear"), creation, crafts; magic; water, seawater and lakewater (a, aba, ab).[6]

            The goat part of the symbol depicts ambition, resolute, intelligence, curiosity, but also steadiness, and ability to thrive in inhospitable environments while the fish represents passion, spirituality, intuition, and connection with the soul. Capricorn is an earth sign so it could features with materialism and cure for property[5] Individuals born between December 21 to January 19 may be called Capricornian.[7]

            Capricorn is third and last of the earth signs in the zodiac, the other two being Taurus and Virgo.
