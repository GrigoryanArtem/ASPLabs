            <p>Scorpio (♏) (Greek: Σκορπιός Skorpios; Latin: Scorpius) is the eighth astrological sign in the Zodiac. It spans the 210–240th degree of the zodiac, between 207.25 and 234.75 degree of celestial longitude. Under the tropical zodiac, the sun transits this area on average from October 23 to November 21, and under the sidereal zodiac, the sun currently transits the constellation of Scorpius from approximately November 16 to December 15.[2] Depending on which zodiac system one uses, an individual born under the influence of Scorpio may be called a Scorpio or a Scorpion.[3]

            Scorpio is one of the three zodiac water signs, the others being Cancer and Pisces.
