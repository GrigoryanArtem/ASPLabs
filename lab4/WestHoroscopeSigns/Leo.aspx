            <p>Leo (♌) (Greek: Λέων, Leōn), is the fifth astrological sign of the zodiac, originating from the constellation of Leo. It comes after Cancer (Greek: Καρκίνος, Karkinos) and before Virgo (Greek: Παρθένος, Parthenos). Under the tropical zodiac, the Sun transits this area approximately between July 23 and August 22;[2] the sign spans the 120th to 150th degree of celestial longitude.

            Leo is a fixed sign along with Taurus, Scorpio, and Aquarius. Under the tropical zodiac, the Sun transits this area on average between July 23 and August 22 each year, and under the sidereal zodiac, the Sun currently transits this area from approximately August 16 to September 15.[3] The symbol of the lion is based on the Nemean lion, a lion with an impenetrable hide.[4] It is a northern sign and its opposite southern sign is Aquarius.[2][5] According to Western astrological beliefs, Leos are usually at bay with Aries, other Leos and Sagittarius.[citation needed] Leos often are best suited with the opposing sign Aquarius and others such as Cancer, Scorpio and Taurus.[citation needed] Leos do not see eye to eye with Pisces and in terms for friendship Capricorn and Taurus are well suiting.
