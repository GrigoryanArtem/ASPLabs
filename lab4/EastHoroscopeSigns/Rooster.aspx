            <p>The Rooster (simplified Chinese: 鸡; traditional Chinese: 雞/鷄) is the tenth sign of the twelve year cycle of animals which appear in the Chinese zodiac (and similar zodiacal systems) related to the Chinese calendar. The Year of the Rooster is represented by the Earthly Branch character 酉. The name is also translated into English as Chicken.

            In the Tibetan zodiac and the Nepalese Gurung zodiac, the "bird" is in place of the Rooster.[1][2] Sometimes even the Fenghuang will take the place of the Rooster.
