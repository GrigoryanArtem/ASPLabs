            <p>The Pig (豬) is the twelfth and the last sign of the Earthly Branches (亥). In the continuous Sexagenary cycle, every twelfth year corresponds to Hai, and is commonly called "the Year of the Pig" (豬年). There are five types of Pigs, named after the Chinese elements. In order, they are: Metal, Water, Wood, Fire, and Earth.

            In the Japanese zodiac and Tibetan zodiac, the Pig is replaced by the boar.[1] In the Dai zodiac, the Pig is replaced by the elephant.[2] In the Gurung zodiac, the Pig is replaced by the deer.</p>
