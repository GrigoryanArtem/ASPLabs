            <p>The Goat (Chinese: 羊; pinyin: yáng) is the eighth sign of the 12-year cycle of animals that appear in the Chinese zodiac related to the Chinese calendar. The sign is also[1] referred to as the Ram or Sheep sign,[2] since the Chinese word yáng is more accurately translated as Caprinae, a taxonomic subfamily that includes both sheep and goats.[3]

                The Year of the Goat is associated with the 8th Earthly Branch symbol, 未 (wèi).
